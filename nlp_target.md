    Sentiment Analysis: Build a model that analyzes the sentiment of text data, classifying it as positive, negative, or neutral. Start with a small dataset and gradually work with larger and more complex datasets.

    Text Classification: Create a model that categorizes text into predefined classes or topics. For example, build a news article classifier that classifies news articles into categories like sports, politics, entertainment, etc.

    Named Entity Recognition: Develop a system that extracts and identifies named entities (such as names of people, organizations, locations) from a given text. Evaluate its performance on various text sources like news articles or social media posts.

    Text Summarization: Build a model that generates a concise summary of a given text. Start with extractive summarization (selecting and combining important sentences) and then progress to abstractive summarization (generating new sentences).

    Language Translation: Create a machine translation system that translates text from one language to another. Start with a simple translation between two languages and then experiment with more complex scenarios and language pairs.

    Question Answering: Develop a system that can answer questions based on a given passage or a corpus of documents. Start with fact-based questions and then move to more complex questions requiring reasoning and comprehension.

    Chatbot: Build a conversational agent that can understand and respond to user queries or engage in dialogue. Start with rule-based systems and then explore more advanced techniques like sequence-to-sequence models or transformer-based approaches.

    Text Generation: Create a model that can generate new text based on a given prompt or style. Start with simpler approaches like Markov chains or recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and then experiment with more sophisticated models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Transformer-based models.

    Document Classification: Build a system that classifies entire documents into categories or topics. Start with simple document classification tasks and then tackle more challenging scenarios, such as multi-label classification or hierarchical classification.

    Language Generation and Style Transfer: Create a model that can generate text in different styles or transfer the style of a given text into another. For example, generating poetry in different genres or transforming formal text into a conversational style.
